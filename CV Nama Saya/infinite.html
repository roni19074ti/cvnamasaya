        <p>Infinite Design is a robust image editing and drawing tool. Now you can use your Android as a professional drawing tablet. Each of the projects you work on from the app allow you to easily
        <img src="infinitee.png" height="100px" align = "right">
        export your files into JPEG, PNG or SVG. Or, if you prefer, you can share them directly through any of your social network accounts. Given the calibre of Infinite Design, you're now capable of working on an unlimited number of layers for each of your images. If you need a way to layer 60 or 70 different images, the app creates a full history of each of the edits you've made. Now you can create and manage each layer easily from the files stored on your smartphone. Similarly, you can use that saved history of layers to re-do and undo any changes you'd like to make.
